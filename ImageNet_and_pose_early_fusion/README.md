# ImageNet to get pose - Early Fusion

The primary idea to the project and the approach can be found in the second section of [Can ImageNet be used for gtting the pose](https://harsh-agarwal.github.io/Can-imageNet-be-Used/).

The new layers that we have written can be found in the README file of the Caffe folder along with the locations at whihc you need to place the respective files and build caffe!

Most of the current implementations use early fusion to get the pose. We wanted to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate how much are we losing if we are going for late fusion. The blog has all the results! 

We are still working upon imporving our late fusion model. Any suggestions are most welcome!
