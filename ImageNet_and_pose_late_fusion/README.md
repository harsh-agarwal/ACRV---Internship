# ImageNet to get pose - Late Fusion

The primary idea to the project and the approach can be found in [Can ImageNet be used for gtting the pose](https://harsh-agarwal.github.io/Can-imageNet-be-Used/).

The new layers that we have written can be found in the README file of the Caffe folder along with the locations at whihc you need to place the respective files and build caffe!

In this experiment we were trying to establish that given some global features we can use that to get a tentative pose. We are trying to improve upon the architecture! Any suggestions are most welcome!
